# ReadableByteStream Docs

In document, the role and semantics of the `ReadableByteStream`-related APIs are explained briefly. We may eventually
move this documentation to somewhere like MDN.

This document is non-normative. Please see the specification for normative definition.

## ReadableByteStream

`ReadableByteStream` has a hidden state. The state can be one of the following:
- `"readable"`: Data may be readable
- `"closed"`: No more data is readable
- `"errored"`: The stream has been errored

The state is not exposed but is observable by calling the methods on the stream or reader.

### getByobReader()

**WARNING: Unstable API**

See [#294](https://github.com/whatwg/streams/issues/294) about method naming.

The `getByobReader` method creates a byob byte stream reader and locks the byte stream to the new reader.

### getReader()

The `getReader` method creates a readable stream reader and locks the byte stream to the new reader.

The reader's `read()` method returns a Uint8Array.

## ReadableByteStreamReader

### get closed()

Used for getting notified that the stream is closed or errored.

If the promise returned by this getter:
- fulfills, that means either of:
    - the stream has been closed
    - the reader has been released while the stream was readable
- rejects, that means either of:
    - the stream has been errored

### cancel(reason)

Tells the byte stream to stop generating or buffering data.

- _reason_: An object indicating the reason why the consumer lost interest

#### Return value

If the returned promise:
- fulfills, that means either of:
    - the stream has been already closed
    - the reader has been already released while the stream was readable
    - the stream was successfully cancelled for this `cancel()` call. In this case, the stream becomes `"closed"`.
- rejects, that means either of:
    - the stream has been already errored
    - the stream was cancelled for this `cancel()` call but the cancellation finished uncleanly. In this case, the stream becomes `"closed"`.

### read()

Used for reading bytes as an `ArrayBufferView` and also for getting notified that the stream is closed or errored.

#### Return value

If the return promise:
- fulfills with _fulfillmentValue_,
    - if _fulfillmentValue_.done is set,
        - that means either of:
            - the stream has been closed
            - the reader has been already released while the stream was readable
        - _fulfillmentValue_.value is set to **undefined**
    - otherwise,
        - that means that bytes were successfully read. The bytes are stored in the region specified by _fulfillmentValue_.value which is an `Uint8Array`
- rejects, that means either of:
    - the stream has been errored

### releaseLock()

Detaches the reader from the stream.

#### Return value and exception

The return value of this method is void (always **undefined** if successful).

If this method returns without throwing, that means either of:
- the reader was released successfully
- the reader has already been released

If this method throws,
- that means that some of `read()` calls haven't yet been completed
- the failure doesn't affect the state of the stream or reader

## ByobByteStreamReader

**WARNING: Unstable API**

### Class Definition

```
class ByobByteStreamReader {
    constructor(byteStream)

    get closed()

    cancel(reason)
    read(view)
    releaseLock()
}
```

### read(view)

Used for reading bytes into `view` and also for getting notified that the stream is closed or errored.

- _view_: An `ArrayBufferView` to which the reader stores the bytes read from the stream

#### Return value

If the return promise:
- fulfills with _fulfillmentValue_,
    - if _fulfillmentValue_.done is set,
        - that means either of:
            - the stream has been closed
            - the reader has been already released while the stream was readable
        - _fulfillmentValue_.value is set to an `ArrayBufferView` of the same type as _view_ with `byteLength` set to 0 and `byteOffset` set to the same value as _view_
    - otherwise,
        - that means that bytes were successfully read. The bytes are stored in the region specified by _fulfillmentValue_.value which is an `ArrayBufferView` of the same type as _view_ with `byteOffset` set to the same value as _view_
- rejects, that means either of:
    - the stream has been errored

#### Algorithm draft

1. If IsReadableByteStreamReader(*this*) is *false*, throw a **TypeError** exception.
1. If **this**@[[state]] is "closed", return a new promise resolved with CreateIterResultObject(_view_, **true**).
1. If **this**@[[state]] is "errored", return a new promise rejected with **this**@[[storedError]].
1. Assert: **this**@[[stream]] is not **undefined**.
1. Assert: **this**@[[stream]]@[[state]] is "readable".
1. If **this**@[[stream]]'s buffer is not empty,
    1. Fill _view_ with the bytes in **this**@[[stream]]'s buffer.
    1. Let _bytesFilled_ be the number of the bytes written to _view_ in the last step, and pop the bytes that have been consumed from **this**@[[stream]]'s buffer in the last step.
1. If **this**@[[stream]] can generate bytes to return synchronously,
    1. Generate bytes into _view_.
1. If non-zero bytes have been written to _view_,
    1. If the bytes are the final bytes to return, call-with-rethrow CloseReadableByteStream(**this**@[[stream]]).
    1. Return a new promise resolved with CreateIterResultObject(_view_, **false**).
1. Otherwise,
    1. Detach the ArrayBuffer object pointed by _view_ from _view_.
    1. Let _view_ be a new reference pointing the ArrayBuffer.
    1. Let _readRequestPromise_ be a new promise.
    1. Append _readRequestPromise_ as the last element of *this*@[[readRequests]].
    1. Run the steps below asynchronously,
        1. Generate bytes into _view_.
        1. Let _newView_ be a new `ArrayBufferView` of the same type whose `buffer` is _view_.buffer, `byteLength` is _view_.byteLength, and `byteOffset` is _view_.byteOffset - _bytesFilled_.
        1. Resolve _readRequestPromise_ with CreateIterResultObject(_newView_, *false*).
    1. Return _readRequestPromise_.
