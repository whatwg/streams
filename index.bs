<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

Large swathes of the web platform are built on streaming data: that is, data that is created, processed, and consumed
in an incremental fashion, without ever reading all of it into memory. The Streams Standard provides a common set of
APIs for creating and interfacing with such streaming data, embodied in <a>readable streams</a>,
<a>writable streams</a>, and <a>transform streams</a>.

This standard provides the base stream primitives which other parts of the web platform can use to expose their
streaming data. For example, [[FETCH]] could expose request bodies as a writable stream, or response bodies as a
readable stream. More generally, the platform is full of streaming abstractions waiting to be expressed as streams:
multimedia streams, file streams, interprocess communication, and more benefit from being able to process data
incrementally instead of buffering it all into memory and processing it in one go. By providing the foundation for
these streams to be exposed to developers, the Streams Standard enables use cases like:

<ul>
  <li> Video effects: piping a readable video stream through a transform stream that applies effects in real time.
  <li> Decompression: piping a file stream through a transform stream that selectively decompresses files from a
    <kbd>.tgz</kbd> archive, turning them into <code>img</code> elements as the user scrolls through an image gallery.
  <li> Image decoding: piping a HTTP response stream through a transform stream that decodes bytes into bitmap data,
    and then through another transform that translates bitmaps into PNGs. If installed inside the <code>fetch</code>
    hook of a service worker [[SERVICE-WORKERS]], this would allow developers to transparently polyfill new image
    formats.
</ul>

The APIs described here provide unifying abstraction for all such streams, encouraging an ecosystem to grow around
these shared and composable interfaces. At the same time, they have been carefully designed to map efficiently to
low-level I/O concerns, and to encapsulate the trickier issues (such as <a>backpressure</a>) that come along for the
ride.

<h2 id="model">Model</h2>

A <dfn>chunk</dfn> is a single piece of data that is written to or read from a stream. It can be of any type; streams
can even contain chunks of different types. A chunk will often not be the most atomic unit of data for a given stream;
for example a binary stream might contain chunks consisting of 16 KiB <code>ArrayBuffer</code>s, instead of single
bytes.

<h3 id="rs-model">Readable Streams</h3>

A <dfn>readable stream</dfn> represents a source of data, from which you can read. In other words, data comes
<em>out</em> of a readable stream.

Although a readable stream can be created with arbitrary behavior, most readable streams wrap a lower-level I/O source,
called the <dfn>underlying source</dfn>. There are two types of underlying source: push sources and pull sources.

<dfn title="push source">Push sources</dfn> push data at you, whether or not you are listening for it. They may also
provide a mechanism for pausing and resuming the flow of data. An example push source is a TCP socket, where data is
constantly being pushed from the OS level, at a rate that can be controlled by changing the TCP window size.

<dfn title="pull source">Pull sources</dfn> require you to request data from them. The data may be available
synchronously, e.g. if it is held by the operating system's in-memory buffers, or asynchronously, e.g. if it has to be
read from disk. An example pull source is a file handle, where you seek to specific locations and read specific amounts.

Readable streams are designed to wrap both types of sources behind a single, unified interface.

<a>Chunks</a> are enqueued into the stream by the stream's creator, who usually derives them from the <a>underlying
source</a>. They can then be read one at a time via the stream's public interface.

Code that reads from a readable stream using its public interface is known as a <dfn>consumer</dfn>.

<h3 id="ws-model">Writable Streams</h3>

A <dfn>writable stream</dfn> represents a destination for data, into which you can write. In other words, data goes
<em>in</em> to a writable stream.

Analogously to readable streams, most writable streams wrap a lower-level I/O sink, called the
<dfn>underlying sink</dfn>. Writable streams work to abstract away some of the complexity of the underlying sink, by
queuing subsequent writes and only delivering them to the underlying sink one by one.

<a>Chunks</a> are enqueued into the stream via its public interface, and are passed one at a time to the stream's
creator. In turn, the creator will usually forward them to the <a>underlying sink</a>.

Code that writes into a writable stream using its public interface is known as a <dfn>producer</dfn>.

<h3 id="ts-model">Transform Streams</h3>

A <dfn>transform stream</dfn> consists of a pair of streams: a writable stream, and a readable stream.
In a manner specific to the transform stream in question, writes to the writable side result in new data being made
available for reading from the readable side.

Some examples of transform streams include:

<ul>
  <li>A GZIP compressor, to which uncompressed bytes are written and from which compressed bytes are read;</li>
  <li>A video decoder, to which encoded bytes are writen and from which uncompressed video frames are read;</li>
  <li>A text decoder, to which bytes are written and from which strings are read;</li>
  <li>A CSV-to-JSON converter, to which strings representing lines of a CSV file are written and from which
    corresponding JavaScript objects are read.
</ul>

<h3 id="pipe-chains">Pipe Chains and Backpressure</h3>

Streams are primarily used by <dfn>piping</dfn> them to each other. A readable stream can be piped directly to a
writable stream, or it can be piped through one or more transform streams first.

A set of streams piped together in this way is referred to as a <dfn>pipe chain</dfn>. In a pipe chain, the
<dfn>original source</dfn> is the <a>underlying source</a> of the first readable stream in the chain; the
<dfn>ultimate sink</dfn> is the <a>underlying sink</a> of the final writable stream in the chain.

Once a pipe chain is constructed, it can be used to propagate signals regarding how fast data should flow through
it. If any step in the chain cannot yet accept data, it propagates a signal backwards through the pipe chain, until
eventually the original source is told to stop producing data so fast. This process of normalizing data flow from the
original source according to how fast the chain can process data is called <dfn>backpressure</dfn>.

<h3 id="queuing-strategies">Internal Queues and Queuing Strategies</h3>

Both readable and writable streams maintain <dfn>internal queues</dfn>, which they use for similar purposes. In the
case of a readable stream, the internal queue contains <a>chunks</a> that have been enqueued by the <a>underlying
source</a>, but not yet read by the consumer. In the case of a writable stream, the internal queue contains
<a>chunks</a> which have been written to the stream by the producer, but not yet processed and acknowledged by the
<a>underlying sink</a>.

A <dfn>queuing strategy</dfn> is a pair of methods that help determine whether a stream should apply
<a>backpressure</a> based on the state of its <a>internal queue</a>. The queuing strategy assigns a size to each
<a>chunk</a>; later, the stream implementation asks the queuing strategy whether the stream should apply backpressure,
based the total size of all chunks in the stream's internal queue.

<div class="example">
  A simple example of a queuing strategy would be one that assigns a size of one to each chunk, and applies
  backpressure whenever three or more chunks are in the internal queue. This would mean that up to three chunks could
  be enqueued in a readable stream, or three chunks could be written to a writable stream, before they send a
  backpressure signal.
</div>

<h3 id="locking">Locking</h3>

<!-- TODO: writable streams too, probably -->

An <dfn>exclusive stream reader</dfn> or simply reader is an object that encapsulates a <a>readable stream</a>,
preventing access to the stream except through the reader's interface. We say in this case the stream is
<dfn title="locked to a reader">locked to the reader</dfn>, and that the reader is
<dfn title="active reader">active</dfn>. A readable stream can have at most one reader at a time.

The reader presents most of the stream's interface, but while it is active, only the reader's methods and properties
can be used to successfully manipulate and interrogate the state of the stream; when the stream is used directly, it
appears as if it is empty.

A reader also has the capability to <dfn title="release a read lock">release its read lock</dfn>, which makes it no
longer active. At this point the original stream can be used as before, and the reader becomes inert. If the
encapsulated stream becomes closed or errored as a result of the behavior of its <a>underlying source</a>, any
associated reader will automatically release its lock.

<h2 id="rs">Readable Streams</h2>

<h3 id="rs-intro">Introduction to Readable Streams</h3>

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

The readable stream API allows wrapping both pull and push sources into a single <code>ReadableStream</code>
abstraction. To accomplish this, the API uses the
<a href="http://domenic.me/2014/02/13/the-revealing-constructor-pattern/">revealing constructor pattern</a>. The
constructor of a given stream instance is supplied with two functions, <code>start</code> and <code>pull</code>, which
each are given the parameters <code>(enqueue, close, error)</code> representing capabilities tied to the internals of
the stream. By mediating all access to the internal state machine through these three functions, the stream's internal
state and bookkeeping can be kept private, allowing nobody but the original producer of the stream to insert data into
it.

<div class="example">
  The following function creates readable streams that wrap web sockets [[HTML]], which are push sources that do not
  support backpressure signals.

  <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
    function makeReadableWebSocketStream(url, protocols) {
      const ws = new WebSocket(url, protocols);
      ws.binaryType = "arraybuffer";

      return new ReadableStream({
        start(enqueue, close, error) {
          // When adapting a push source, usually most of the work happens in start.

          ws.onmessage = event => enqueue(event.data);
          ws.onend = close;
          ws.onerror = error;
        },

        cancel() {
          ws.close();
        }
      });
    }
  </code></pre>

  We can then use this function to create readable streams for web sockets, and pipe those streams to arbitrary
  writable streams:

  <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
    var webSocketStream = makeReadableWebSocketStream("http://example.com", 80);

    webSocketStream.pipeTo(writableStream)
      .then(() => console.log("All data successfully written!"))
      .catch(e => console.error("Something went wrong!", e));
  </code></pre>
</div>

<div class="example">
  The following function wraps a push source, represented by a hypothetical "raw socket" interface, which triggers
  events for data, end, and error (much like a web socket), but also provides the ability to pause and resume the flow
  of data. Thus, this example shows how to apply backpressure to <a>underlying sources</a> that support it.

  <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
    function makeSocketStream(host, port) {
      const rawSocket = createRawSocketObject(host, port);

      return new ReadableStream({
        start(enqueue, close, error) {
          rawSocket.ondata = event => {
            if (!enqueue(event.data)) {
              // If enqueue returns false, the internal queue is full, so propagate
              // the backpressure signal to the underlying source.
              rawSocket.readStop();
            }
          };

          rawSocket.onend = close;
          rawSocket.onerror = error;
        },

        pull() {
          // This is called if the internal queue has been emptied, but the
          // stream's consumer still wants more data. In that case, restart
          // the flow of data if we have previously paused it.
          rawSocket.readStart();
        },

        cancel() {
          rawSocket.readStop();
        }
      });
    }
  </code></pre>

  We can then use this function to create readable streams for such "raw sockets" in the same way we do for web
  sockets. This time, however, when we pipe to a destination that cannot accept data as fast as the socket is producing
  it, a backpressure signal will be sent to the raw socket.
</div>

<div class="example">
  The following function wraps a pull source, represented by a "raw file handle," which provides methods for opening,
  reading from, and closing itself. These methods can call their callbacks either synchronously or asynchronously—a
  <a href="http://blog.izs.me/post/59142742143/designing-apis-for-asynchrony">Zalgo-releasing</a> horror which we can
  hide from our users by wrapping them in a readable stream.

  <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
    function makeReadableFileStream(filename) {
      const fileHandle = createRawFileHandle(filename, "r");

      return new ReadableStream({
        start() {
          return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            fileHandle.open(err => {
              if (err) {
                reject(err);
              }
              resolve();
            });
          });
        },

        pull(enqueue, close, error) {
          // When adapting a pull source, usually most of the work happens in pull.

          fileHandle.read((err, isDone, chunk) => {
            if (err) {
              // If trying to read data results in an error, report that.
              error(err);
            } else if (isDone) {
              // If there's no more data to read, be sure to close the underlying
              // source, ensuring that it succeeds before reporting success.
              fileHandle.close(err => {
                if (err) {
                  error(err);
                }
                close();
              });
            } else {
              // If data was read successfully, enqueue it into the internal queue.
              enqueue(chunk);
            }
          });
        },

        cancel() {
          fileHandle.close();
        }
      });
    }
  </code></pre>

  We can then create and use readable streams for files just as we could before for sockets.
</div>

<div class="example">
  Although readable streams will usually be used by piping them to a writable stream, you can also "pump" them
  directly, alternating between using the <code>read()</code> method and the <code>ready</code> getter according to the current
  value of the <code>state</code> property. For example, this function writes the contents of a readable stream to the
  console as fast as they are available.

  <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
    function streamToConsole(readableStream) {
      readableStream.closed.then(
        () => console.log("--- all done!"),
        e => console.error(e);
      );

      pump();

      function pump() {
        while (readableStream.state === "readable") {
          console.log(readableStream.read());
        }

        if (readableStream.state === "waiting") {
          readableStream.ready.then(pump);
        }

        // otherwise "closed" or "errored", which will be handled above.
      }
    }
  </code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="rs-state-diagram">The Readable Stream State Diagram</h3>

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

As evidenced by the above explanations, readable streams have a fairly complex internal state machine, which is
responsible for keeping track of the internal queue, and initiating appropriate actions in response to calls to a
stream's methods. This can be roughly summarized in the following diagram.

<figure>

<h3 id="rs-class">Class <code>ReadableStream</code></h3>

<h4 id="rs-class-definition">Class Definition</h4>

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

If one were to write the <code>ReadableStream</code> class in something close to the syntax of [[!ECMASCRIPT]], it
would look like

<pre><code class="lang-javascript">
  class ReadableStream {
    constructor({
      start = (enqueue, close, error) => {},
      pull = (enqueue, close, error) => {},

      strategy = %DefaultReadableStreamStrategy%
    } = {})

    get closed()
    get ready()
    get state()

    cancel(reason)
    getReader()
    pipeThrough({ writable, readable }, options)
    pipeTo(dest, { preventClose, preventAbort, preventCancel } = {})
    read()
  }
</code></pre>

<h4 id="rs-internal-slots">Internal Slots</h4>

Instances of <code>ReadableStream</code> are created with the internal slots described in the following table:

<div class="note">
  The constructor is passed several functions, all optional, which govern how the constructed stream instance behaves:

  <ul>
    <li> <var>start</var>(<var>enqueue</var>, <var>close</var>, <var>error</var>) is called immediately, and is
      typically used to adapt a <a>push source</a> by setting up relevant event listeners, or to acquire access to a
      <a>pull source</a>. If this process is asynchronous, it can return a promise to signal success or failure.
    <li> <var>pull</var>(<var>enqueue</var>, <var>close</var>, <var>error</var>) is called when the stream's internal
      queue of chunks is depleted, and the consumer has signaled that they wish to consume more data. Once it is
      called, it will not be called again until the passed <var>enqueue</var> callback is called.
    <li> <var>cancel</var>(<var>reason</var>) is called when the consumer signals that they are no longer interested
      in the stream. It should perform any actions necessary to release access to the <a>underlying source</a>. If this
      process is asynchronous, it can return a promise to signal success or failure.

<h5 id="rs-get-reader">getReader()</h5>

<div class="note">
  The <code>getReader</code> method creates an <a>exclusive stream reader</a> and
  <a title="locked to a reader">locks</a> the stream to the the new reader. While the stream is locked, it cannot be
  manipulated directly, and will appear to be an inert, empty stream waiting for new <a>chunks</a> to be enqueued.
  Instead, the returned reader object can be used to read from or cancel the stream, or to discern its state and state
  transitions. If or when the lock is <a title="release a read lock">released</a>, the stream can be used again as
  normal.

  This functionality is especially useful for creating abstractions that desire the ability to consume a stream in its
  entirety. By getting a reader for the stream, you can ensure nobody else can interleave reads with yours, interfering
  with your abstraction or observing its side-effects.

  Note that when a stream is closed or errors, any reader it is locked to is automatically released.

<h2 id="ws">Writable Streams</h2>

<h3 id="ws-intro">Introduction to Writable Streams</h3>

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

The writable stream API allows wrapping of <a>underlying sinks</a> into an object on which two fundamental operations
can be performed: <a>chunks</a> can be written to the stream, and the stream can be closed.

The writable stream implementation is designed to encapsulate the potential complexity of the <a>underlying sink</a>
from users of the stream API. In particular, users of a stream object can write chunks to the stream at any pace,
without regard for whether previous writes have completed or succeeded. It is the job of the stream implementation to
ensure that writes are forwarded to the <a>underlying sink</a> in order, and only after successful completion of
previous writes. This allows seamless use of the writable stream even in cases such as piping a fast readable file
stream to a slower writable network socket stream, which cannot acknowledge the incoming data at the same rate it
becomes available.

<div class="example">
  The following function wraps a web socket [[HTML]] as the <a>underlying sink</a> of a new writable stream. Web
  sockets do not provide any way to tell when a given chunk of data has been successfully sent, so this writable stream
  has no ability to communicate backpressure signals to any users: it will always be in the <code>"writable"</code>
  state.

  <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
    function makeWritableWebSocketStream(url, protocols) {
      const ws = new WebSocket(url, protocols);

      return new WritableStream({
        start(error) {
          ws.onerror = error;
          return new Promise(resolve => ws.onopen = resolve);
        },

        write(chunk) {
          ws.send(chunk);
          // Return immediately, since the web socket gives us no way to tell
          // when the write completes.
        },

        close() {
          return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            ws.onclose = resolve;
            ws.close();
          });
        }
      });
    }
  </code></pre>
</div>

<div class="example">
  The following function wraps an <a>underlying sink</a>, represented as a hypothetical "raw file handle," which
  provides methods for opening, writing to, and closing itself. Notably, the raw file handle's <code>write</code> method
  calls back to signal when writes are complete, which allows the stream to correctly communicate backpressure signals

  <a href="http://blog.izs.me/post/59142742143/designing-apis-for-asynchrony">Zalgo-releasing</a> horror which we can
  hide from our users by wrapping them in a writable stream.

  <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
    function makeWritableFileStream(filename) {
      const fileHandle = createRawFileHandle(filename, "w");

      return new WritableStream({
        start() {
          return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            fileHandle.open(err => {
              if (err) {
                reject(err);
              }
              resolve();
            });
          });
        },

        write(chunk) {
          return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            fileHandle.write(chunk, writeErr => {
              if (writeErr) {
                // If trying to write results in an error, (attempt to) close the
                // underlying file handle; we're not going to write any more.
                fileHandle.close(closeErr => {
                  // If *closing* errors, pass along that error to the stream.
                  if (closeErr) {
                    reject(closeErr);
                  }

                  // Otherwise, if closing succeeds, pass along the write error.
                  reject(writeErr);
                });
              } else {
                // If there's no error, then signal that this write completed.
                resolve();
              }
            });
          });
        },

        close() {
          return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            fileHandle.close(err => {
              if (err) {
                reject(err);
              }
              resolve();
            });
          });
        }
      });
    }
  </code></pre>

  We can then use this function to create a writable stream for a file, and then pipe a readable stream to it:

  <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
    var fileStream = makeWritableFileStream("/example/path/on/fs.txt");

    readableStream.pipeTo(fileStream)
      .then(() => console.log("All data successfully written!"))
      .catch(e => console.error("Something went wrong!", e));
  </code></pre>

  Note that if a particular call to <code>fileHandle.write</code> takes a longer time, <code>done</code> will be
  called later. In the meantime, additional writes can be queued up, which are stored in the stream's internal queue.
  The accumulation of this queue can move the stream into a <code>"waiting"</code> state, which is a signal to users
  of the stream that they should back off and stop writing if possible.
</div>

<div class="example">
  Although writable streams will usually be used by piping to them from a readable stream, you can also write to them
  directly. Since they queue any incoming writes, and take care internally to forward them to the <a>underlying sink</a>
  in sequence, you can indiscriminately write to a writable stream without much ceremony:

  <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
    function writeArrayToStream(array, writableStream) {
      array.forEach(chunk => writableStream.write(chunk));

      return writableStream.close();
    }

    writeArrayToStream([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], writableStream)
      .then(() => console.log("All done!"))
      .catch(e => console.error("Error with the stream: " + e));
  </code></pre>

<h4 id="ws-constructor">new WritableStream({ start, write, close, abort, strategy } = {})</h4>

<div class="note">
  The constructor is passed several functions, all optional, which govern how the constructed stream instance behaves:

  <ul>
    <li> <var>start</var>(<var>error</var>) is called immediately, and should perform any actions necessary to acquire
      access to the <a>underlying sink</a>. If this process is asynchronous, it can return a promise to signal success
      or failure.
    <li> <var>write</var>(<var>chunk</var>) is called when a new <a>chunk</a> of data is ready to be written to the
      <a>underlying sink</a>. It can return a promise to signal success or failure of the write operation. The stream
      implementation guarantees that this function will be called only after previous writes have succeeded, and never
      after <var>close</var> or <var>abort</var> is called.
    <li> <var>close</var>() is called after the producer signals that they are done writing chunks to the stream, and
      all queued-up writes successfully complete. It should perform any actions necessary to finalize writes to the
      <a>underlying sink</a>, and release access to it. If this process is asynchronous, it can return a promise to
      signal success or failure. The stream implementation guarantees that this function will be called only after all
      queued-up writes have succeeded.
    <li> <var>abort</var>(<var>reason</var>) is called when the producer signals they wish to abruptly close the stream
      and put it in an <code>"errored"</code> state. It should clean up any held resources, much like <var>close</var>,
      but perhaps with some custom handling. Unlike <var>close</var>, <var>abort</var> will be called even if writes
      are queued up; those <a>chunks</a> will be thrown away. If this process is asynchronous, it can return a promise
      to signal success or failure. If no abort function is passed, by default the <var>close</var> function will be
      called instead.
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="note">
  Due to the way writable streams asynchronously close, it is possible for both <var>close</var> and <var>abort</var>
  to be called, in cases where the <a>producer</a> aborts the stream while it is in the <code>"closing"</code> state.
  Notably, since a stream always spends at least one turn in the <code>"closing"</code> state, code like
  <code>ws.close(); ws.abort(...);</code> will cause both to be called, even if the <var>close</var> function itself
  has no asynchronous behavior. A well-designed <a>underlying source</a> should be able to deal with this.

</div>

<ol>
  <li> Return <b>this</b>@\[[closedPromise]].
</ol>

<h5 id="ws-ready">get ready</h5>

<div class="note">
  The <code>ready</code> getter returns a promise that will be fulfilled when the stream transitions away from the
  <code>"waiting"</code> state to any other state. Once the stream transitions back to <code>"waiting"</code>, the
  getter will return a new promise that stays pending until the next state transition.

  In essence, this promise gives a signal as to when any backpressure has let up (or that the stream has been closed
  or errored).
</div>

<ol>
  <li> Return <b>this</b>@\[[readyPromise]].
</ol>

<h5 id="ws-state">get state</h5>

<div class="note">
  The <code>state</code> getter returns the state of the stream, which will be one of the following:

  <dl>
    <dt><code>"waiting"</code>
    <dd>The stream's internal queue is full; that is, the stream is
      exerting <a>backpressure</a>. Use <code>.ready</code> to be notified of when the pressure subsides.

    <dt><code>"writable"</code>
    <dd>The stream's internal queue is not full; call <code>.write()</code> until backpressure is exerted.

    <dt><code>"closing"</code>
    <dd>The stream's <code>.close()</code> method has been called, and a command to close is in the queue or
      being processed by the <a>underlying sink</a>; attempts to write will now fail.

    <dt><code>"closed"</code>
    <dd>The <a>underlying sink</a> has been closed; writing is no longer possible.

    <dt><code>"errored"</code>
    <dd>An error occurred interacting with the <a>underlying sink</a> or the stream has been aborted, so the stream is
      now dead.

<div class="note">
  The <code>close</code> method signals that the producer is done writing chunks to the stream and wishes to move the

  the chunk to the underlying sink.

  The impact of enqueuing this chunk will be immediately reflected in the stream's <code>state</code> property; in

<h3 id="default-ws-strategy">%DefaultWritableStreamStrategy%</h3>

%DefaultWritableStreamStrategy% is a well-known intrinsic object representing the default <a>queuing strategy</a> for

<h2 id="ts">Transform Streams</h2>

Transform streams have been developed in the testable implementation, but not yet re-encoded in spec language.
We are waiting to validate their design before doing so. In the meantime, see

<h3 id="blqs-class">Class <code>ByteLengthQueuingStrategy</code></h3>

A common <a>queuing strategy</a> when dealing with binary data is to wait until the accumulated <code>byteLength</code>
properties of the incoming chunks reaches a specified high-water mark. As such, this is provided as a built-in
<a>queuing strategy</a> that can be used when constructing streams.

<h4 id="blqs-class-definition">Class Definition</h4>

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

If one were to write the <code>ByteLengthQueuingStrategy</code> class in something close to the syntax of

<h3 id="cqs-class">Class <code>CountQueuingStrategy</code></h3>

A common <a>queuing strategy</a> when dealing with streams of generic objects is to simply count the number of chunks

<h3 id="queue-with-sizes">Queue-with-Sizes Operations</h3>

The streams in this specification use a "queue-with-sizes" data structure to store queued up values, along with their
determined sizes. A queue-with-sizes is a List of Records with \[[value]] and \[[size]] fields (although in
implementations it would of course be backed by a more efficient data structure).

A number of abstract operations are specified here to make working with queues-with-sizes more pleasant, and used
throughout the rest of this standard.

<h4 id="dequeue-value">DequeueValue ( queue )</h4>

<ol>
  <li> Assert: <var>queue</var> is not empty.
  <li> Let <var>pair</var> be the first element of queue.
  <li> Remove <var>pair</var> from <var>queue</var>, shifting all other elements downward (so that the second becomes
    the first, and so on).
  <li> Return <var>pair</var>.\[[value]].
</ol>

<h4 id="enqueue-value-with-size">EnqueueValueWithSize ( queue, value, size )</h4>

<ol>
  <li> Let <var>size</var> be ToNumber(<var>size</var>).
  <li> ReturnIfAbrupt(<var>size</var>).
  <li> If <var>size</var> is <b>NaN</b>, <b>+∞</b>, or <b>−∞</b>, throw a <b>RangeError</b> exception.
  <li> Append Record{\[[value]]: <var>value</var>, \[[size]]: <var>size</var>} as the last element of <var>queue</var>.

<ol>
  <li> Let <var>totalSize</var> be <b>0</b>.
  <li> Repeat for each Record{\[[value]], \[[size]]} <var>pair</var> that is an element of <var>queue</var>,
    <ol>
      <li> Assert: <var>pair</var>.\[[size]] is a finite, non-<b>NaN</b> number.
      <li> Add <var>pair</var>.\[[size]] to <var>totalSize</var>.
    </ol>
  <li> Return <var>totalSize</var>.
</ol>

<h4 id="peek-queue-value">PeekQueueValue ( queue )</h4>

<ol>
  <li> Assert: <var>queue</var> is not empty.
  <li> Let <var>pair</var> be the first element of <var>queue</var>.
  <li> Return <var>pair</var>.\[[value]].
</ol>

<h2 id="subclassing">Subclassing Streams</h2>

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

Specific APIs may wish to subclass <code>ReadableStream</code> or <code>WritableStream</code> in order to provide
additional functionality. Examples would include:

<ul>
  <li>A file stream that is constructed from a filename, and includes file metadata</li>
  <li>A HTTP stream that is constructed from a URL, and includes header-accessing APIs</li>
  <li>A TCP stream that overrides <code>read</code>, <code>ready</code>, <code>cancel</code>, <code>state</code>, and
  <code>closed</code> to reflect and manipulate a kernel-level TCP buffer</li>
</ul>

The first two examples here could be expressed by allowing their constructors to call <code>super</code> with
appropriate functions that manipulate the stream's internal state. The latter takes a different approach, which gives
both more power and more responsibility: it requires that the author of that stream manually implement many of the
complex requirements baked into the readable stream state machine and the contract it presents to users.

Because streams only interact through their public API, all streams—whether subclassed or not—can coexist and
interoperate. For example, you can pipe to or from any of the above streams, without worrying what type of
implementation is under the covers, since they all provide the appropriate properties and methods.

<h2 id="conventions" class="no-num">Conventions</h2>

This specification uses algorithm conventions very similar to those of [[!ECMASCRIPT]]. However, it deviates in the
following ways, mostly for brevity. It is hoped (and vaguely planned) that eventually the conventions of ECMAScript
itself will evolve in these ways.

<ul>
  <li> We use destructuring notation in function and method declarations, and assume that the destructuring assignment
    procedure was performed before the algorithm starts.
  <li> We similarly use the default argument notation <code>= {}</code> in a couple of cases.
  <li> We use the notation <var>x</var>@\[[y]] to refer to internal slots of an object, instead of saying "the \[[y]]
    internal slot of <var>x</var>."
  <li> We do not alias <b>this</b> to a local variable in each algorithm, instead using it directly.
  <li> We use the phrase "calling <var>x</var>(<var>y</var>, <var>z</var>, w</var>)" as a shorthand for "calling the
    \[[Call]] internal method of <var>x</var> passing <b>undefined</b> as <var>thisArgument</var> and (<var>y</var>,
    <var>z</var>, <var>w</var>) as <var>argumentsList</var>."
  <li> We use the phrase "call-with-rethrow AbstractOperation(<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, <var>z</var>)" as a shorthand
    for "Let <var>opResult</var> be AbstractOperation(<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, <var>z</var>).
    ReturnIfAbrupt(<var>opResult</var>)."
  <li> We use <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/promises-guide/#shorthand-phrases">the shorthand phrases from the W3C
    TAG promises guide</a> to operate on promises at a higher level than the ECMAScript spec does.
  <li> We introduce the notion of creating a function that "closes over" a given variable. This is meant to work the
    same as how the ECMAScript spec gives such functions internal slots which get filled in upon creation and then
    have their values pulled out of during execution, but require less formal contortions.
  <li> We have use the phrase "no-op function" as a shorthand, without bothering to give it a formal definition.
</ul>
